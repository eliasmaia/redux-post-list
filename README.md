# redux-post-list
This is a project of a read-only mobile app made with Redux/React-native. 

The project basically fetches data from a web api, and has two screens, two scenes: One that shows a list of posts, and another one that shows the detail information of the post the user click on.

This project was made following up the [Aprenda Redux com React Native - Tutorial do Zero (Curso Gratis Completo para Iniciante)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6MHvWkLzQs&list=PLUbb2i4BuuzBP9eD4ZO7J1qxpf4TKNchG) Youtube video course, provided and made by [@nbkhope](https://www.github.com/nbkhope).
